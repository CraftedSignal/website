# Hero Section

[heroTitle]
other = "SignalForge treats SOC detections like software: canonical rules, validated translation, and health guardrails before an alert ever runs."

[heroDescription]
other = "Start with MITRE-aligned intent, write canonical IR that passes schema lint, unit fixtures, and replay, then translate safely across every SIEM/XDR with scoped canaries, blast radius controls, and audit trails. Noise budgets, cost caps, and data-contract horming keep teams honest while the orchestration engine enforces approvals and rollbacks for you."

[heroStep1]
other = "1) Ideate a rule, map to MITRE, capture noise/cost expectations."

[heroStep2]
other = "2) Build canonical IR, run lint + unit + replay tests, log portability and capability scores."

[heroStep3]
other = "3) Shadow eval with projected alerts/cost, submit the canary to approvals, and guard noise budgets."

[heroStep4]
other = "4) Monitor TTDetect/TTRem, SNR, parser drift, and auto-suggest tuning or retirement."
