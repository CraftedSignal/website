These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of CraftedSignal ("Service"), operated by CraftedSignal ("we", "us", "our"). By using the Service you agree to these Terms.

---

## 1. Definitions

- **Service** — the CraftedSignal platform, including the SaaS offering at app.craftedsignal.io, the self-hosted binary, the CLI (`csctl`), and all related documentation.
- **User** — any individual or entity that accesses or uses the Service.
- **Content** — detection rules, configurations, and other data you create or upload.

## 2. Account

You must provide accurate information when creating an account. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your credentials. Notify us immediately at [security@craftedsignal.io](mailto:security@craftedsignal.io) if you suspect unauthorized access.

## 3. Acceptable use

You may use the Service only for lawful purposes related to detection engineering and security operations. You may not:

- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or its infrastructure
- Reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Service
- Use the Service to develop a competing product
- Circumvent any usage limits or access controls

## 4. Your content

You retain ownership of all Content you create or upload. We do not claim any intellectual property rights over your Content. We access your Content only as necessary to operate and improve the Service.

We do not use your Content to train AI models. See our [Privacy Policy](/privacy/) for details on data handling.

## 5. Service availability

We aim for high availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted access. We may perform scheduled maintenance with reasonable notice. We are not liable for downtime caused by factors outside our control.

## 6. Self-hosted deployments

Self-hosted deployments run entirely on your infrastructure. We have no access to your data, logs, or network. License keys encode your plan limits and are validated locally.

## 7. Third-party integrations

The Service integrates with third-party SIEM platforms (e.g., Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, CrowdStrike, Rapid7). Your use of those platforms is governed by their respective terms. We are not responsible for any third-party service's availability, accuracy, or conduct.

## 8. Free tier

The free tier is provided as-is with no SLA. We reserve the right to modify free tier limits with 30 days' notice.

## 9. Paid plans

Paid plans are billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis. Prices may change with 30 days' notice. You may cancel at any time; access continues until the end of the billing period.

## 10. Intellectual property

The Service, including its code, design, documentation, and trademarks, is owned by CraftedSignal. Nothing in these Terms grants you rights to our intellectual property beyond what is needed to use the Service.

## 11. Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, CraftedSignal is not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including lost profits, data loss, or business interruption.

Our total liability for any claim arising from these Terms is limited to the amount you paid us in the 12 months preceding the claim.

## 12. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold CraftedSignal harmless from claims arising from your use of the Service, your Content, or your violation of these Terms.

## 13. Termination

Either party may terminate at any time. On termination, your right to access the Service ends. We will make your Content available for export for 30 days after termination.

## 14. Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via the Service or email at least 30 days in advance. Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.

## 15. Governing law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the Netherlands. Any disputes will be resolved in the courts of Amsterdam.
